# Rice Leaf Disease Diagnosis CNN Model

This project focuses on diagnosing rice leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow. The model aims to classify different types of diseases affecting rice leaves to help farmers take appropriate actions to protect their crops.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy (~99%) in classifying rice leaf diseases in 4 types of diseases including:
    - Bacterialblight
    - Blast
    - Brownspot
    - Tungro

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. In the file `test_saved_model.ipynb`, pass image directory in your computer to `img_path` variable
4. Click `Run All` in the task bar above.
