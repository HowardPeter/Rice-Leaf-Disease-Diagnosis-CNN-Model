# Rice Leaf Disease Diagnosis CNN Model

This project focuses on diagnosing rice leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow. The model aims to classify different diseases affecting rice leaves to help farmers take appropriate actions to protect their crops.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy (~99%) in classifying rice leaf diseases in 4 types of diseases including Bacterial blight, Blast, Brownspot, Tungro

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. In the file `test_saved_model.ipynb`, pass the image directory of the rice leaf in your computer to the `img_path` variable
4. Click `Run All` in the task bar above.
